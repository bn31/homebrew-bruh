### About
This is my first real programming project, I wanted to make something really stupid and I feel as if I have succeeded. Written in python using [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/).

### Installation
```
brew tap bn31/bruh
brew install bruh
```
### Usage
Inside your terminal type `bruh` to have the sound play. In this version (v0.0.1-alpha) the command isn't properly spammable because of the 1.5 second cooldown. Within the next release this should be fixed.
